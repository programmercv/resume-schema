### prtfl.io Resume Schema

The prtfl.io Resume Standard is an open source [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) Definition to store résumé data.

It is heavely influenced by the existing resume standards [FRESCA](https://github.com/fresh-standard/FRESCA) and [JSONResume](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema), then cherry-picked and adopted to the needs and requirements of [prtfl.io](https://prtfl.io) and [ResumeExporter](https://github.com/prtflio/resume_exporter).

## Why?

Not really intended to set *the standard* for résumés, nor to replace existing ones. In fact, prtfl.io and RésuméExporter are designed to work with FRESCA- and JSONResume-based schemas. But both schema definitions were missing some elements, and we needed a clearly defined schema definition for [prtfl.io](https://prtfl.io) and the prtfl.io jekyll theme (coming soon), in a public place, where people can read, understand, discuss, change and use it.
